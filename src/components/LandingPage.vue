        <p>Dear participant,</p>
        <p>
          Thank you for your interest in participating in this study. This
          experiment is designed to deepen our current understanding of user
          experience with customer support chatbots. Each participant, including
          yourself, will interact with a specific version of a chatbot. Other
          participants may encounter different versions. By gathering feedback
          on these interactions, we aim to explore how design elements influence
          user perceptions of trust in chatbots within the customer support
          setting.

          Your Role
        </h2>
        <p>
          In this experiment, you will assume the role of a customer who has
          recently made several online purchases from a fictitious online
          retailer.
        </p>
        <p>You’ve ordered three different items:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Order A:</strong> A product that you’re eagerly waiting for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Order B:</strong> Another item that you purchased recently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Order C:</strong> An item that has already been delivered to
            you.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Now, you need to manage these orders through the retailer’s customer
          support chatbot. Your customer number is
          <strong><u>123-456</u></strong
          >. Here’s what you need to do:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Track Order A:</strong> You’re curious about the status of
            Order A and want to know its current location and the expected
            delivery date.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Change the Delivery Address for Order B:</strong> You
            realized that you accidentally entered your home address for Order
            B, but it’s meant to be delivered to your office. You want to update
            the delivery address to ensure it arrives at the correct location.
            (You can invent your own office address, but please follow this
            exaple format: <strong>Büro Straße 1, 12345 Stadtname</strong>)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Return Order C:</strong> Unfortunately, Order C doesn’t fit
            as expected. Since you know the retailer has a 30-day return policy,
            you decide to initiate a return.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

          Next Steps
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you have completed all the tasks, you’ll be directed to a
          questionnaire where you can share your feedback and evaluation of the
          chatbot. The entire process, including the chatbot interaction and the
          questionnaire, should take about 20 minutes.
